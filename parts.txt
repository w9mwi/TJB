Hi,

This is for ORDER NO. 25109.

Enclosed are 2 Herbst appliance INNER RODS, and 2 Herbst appliance OUTER TUBES.

As we discussed via e-mail, I would like all 4 of these Herbst appliance parts trimmed as follows:

___ Trim the LONGEST of the 2 INNER RODS by 2.5 millimeters.

___ Trim the SHORTEST of the 2 INNER RODS by 1.5 millimeters.

___ Trim BOTH of the OUTER TUBES by 1.5 millimeters.

To make it easy, I marked each of the 2 INNER RODS and the 2 OUTER TUBES with a label specifying how many millimeters to trim from each part.

I hope you can accurately measure to one-half of a millimeter (0.5 millimeters).

IMPORTANT!...
If you can't trim to 0.5 millimeter accuracy, it's OK to trim to a MAXIMUM of 3.0 millimeters for the longest INNER ROD, and a MAXIMUM of 2.0 millimeters for the other 3 parts.  But if possible, please try to obtain 0.5 millimeter accuracy.

PLEASE DON'T MAIL THE HERBST APPLIANCE PARTS UNTIL YOU FIRST NOTIFY ME VIA E-MAIL.

My e-mail addres is:  w9mwi@yahoo.com

After I approve, please mail the 4 trimmed Herbst appliance parts to:

TOM BOURIL
4502 ODANA RD.

Thank you.
