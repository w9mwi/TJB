I have ordered this appliance:
https://www.bracesshop.com/en/fake-braces/58/telescopic-appliance-with-rpe-and-brackets

Below is a checklist of instructions that must be followed when making this new
appliance for Tom Bouril.

If the following checklist of instructions are not followed correctly,
the appliance may not be acceptable.

PLEASE USE THIS CHECKLIST WHEN MAKING THE APPLIANCE.


____ 1) APPLIANCE DURABILITY (PART 1 of 2)
        To minimize the chance of my new appliance breaking, I would like
        it to be as strong, and duarble, as possible.  So I included
        TWO (2) large, thick wires to be used when making the appliance.
        The appliance's metal brackets would be welded to this wire.

        Use my wires to make the new appliance ONLY IF you believe my wires
        will work well with the new appliance, by making it stronger.  If
        you believe my wires will NOT work well with the new appliance,
        then DON'T USE THEM.

        THIS IS YOUR CHOICE!  USE THE WIRE YOU BELIEVE WILL WORK BEST!


____ 2) APPLIANCE DURABILITY (PART 2 of 2)
        To minimize the chance of breaking, do NOT make my new appliance fit
        tight.  The appliance should fit "A LITTLE LOOSE" to MINIMIZE TENSION,
        MINIMIZE PRESSURE, and MINIMIZE POSSIBLE BREAKAGE.


____ 3) HEADGEAR TUBES AND FACEBOW
        In an e-mail that you sent, you said you'd include a facebow
        that fits the 2 headgear tubes on my new appliance.  Please
        make this a LARGE, ADULT-SIZE FACEBOW.  I believe that's a
        Size 6 (or maybe a Size 5) facebow.


____ 4) ELASTIC HOOKS (PART 1 of 2)
        Notice the TWO (2) ELASTIC HOOKS on the upper retainer that I sent.
        WELD TWO (2) LARGE ELASTIC HOOKS TO MY NEW APPLIANCE, IN THE SAME
        LOCATION AS THEY'RE LOCATED ON MY RETAINER.  (FYI, the elastic hooks
        on my retainer are too small.)  Make those 2 elastic hooks on my new
        appliance LARGE, BIG, ELASTIC HOOKS.

        (NOTE: The wire on my retainer was already broken, before I mailed it.)


____ 5) ELASTIC HOOKS (PART 2 of 2)
        If you look at photos of this appliance on your web site...

        SEE:  https://www.bracesshop.com/en/fake-braces/58/telescopic-appliance-with-rpe-and-brackets

         ...you will see that SOME (not all) brackets contain a small elastic hook,
         with a spherical ball at the end of the hook.

         Please use brackets that include these elastic hooks for as many brackets as possible.


____ 6) BRACKET TYPE
        Use the LARGEST METAL BRACKETS possible.


____ 7) BRACKET LIGATURES
        On the metal brackets...
        Do NOT use elastic power chains.
        Do NOT use elastic ligatures.
        USE METAL-WIRE LIGATURES.


____ 8) FUTURE ORDER FOR RETAINERS
        There's a good chance I might order some retainers from BracesShop
        in the future.  So I mailed a package of "flat-wire" retainer wires.
        PLEASE KEEP THIS PACKAGE (AND MY PLASTER TEETH MODELS) FOR POSSIBLE
        FUTURE USE.  So if I place another order, I won't have to mail
        new teeth impressions, or retainer wires.


____ 9) BEFORE YOU MAIL MY APPLIANCE (PART 1 of 2)
        When my new appliance is finished and ready to be mailed, do NOT mail it
        until you FIRST SEND ME AN E-MAIL with some photos of the new appliance.

        Mail my new appliance ONLY AFTER I REPLY to your e-mail, and I tell you
        it's OK to mail it.


____ 10) BEFORE YOU MAIL MY APPLIANCE (PART 2 of 2)
         When you mail my new appliance, please do the following...

         ____ Place MY NEW APPLIANCE in one of the two retainer cases that I sent.

         ____ Place MY RETAINER that I sent you in one of the two retainer cases that I sent.

         ____ If some of the LONG, THICK retainer wires I sent remain, return them.
              But DON'T return the package of "flat-wire" retainer wires.


____ 11) MAILING AND CONTACT INFO
         If you have questions, send an e-mail to:  w9mwi@yahoo.com

         Mail the appliance to:
         TOM BOURIL
